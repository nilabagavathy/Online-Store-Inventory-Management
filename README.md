Inventory management system using Bubble, Airtable, Jotform, Make, and n8n

 Online Store Inventory Management

Project Overview
This project implements an Online Store Inventory Management System to manage products, track stock levels, and update inventory in real time using low-code tools.

 Tools Used
- Bubble – Web application for inventory display
- Airtable – Database for products and sales
- Jotform – Forms for product and sales input
- Make – Automation for stock and sales updates
- n8n – Data synchronization and reporting
- ChatGPT – Planning and logic assistance
- Notion AI – Documentation and workflow design

 Automation Logic
- When a sale occurs, the Make workflow updates:
  - Sales = Sales + 1
  - Stock = Stock - 1
- Bubble reflects updated data in real time from Airtable.

 System Workflow
1. Product or sale data is submitted through Jotform  
2. Data is stored and managed in Airtable  
3. Make automation triggers when a sale occurs  
4. Inventory is updated automatically:
   - Sales = Sales + 1  
   - Stock = Stock − 1  
5. Updated inventory data is reflected in the Bubble application in real time  
6. n8n processes data for synchronization and reporting  

 Conclusion
This project demonstrates a real-time, automated inventory management system using no-code and low-code platforms.
